# Primary Election and confirmed cases by state 

## President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020. After that, presidential primary elections happened in four states: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Wisconsin. 

#### •	I was wondering if there would be any change in number; if four the states have higher, lower, or about the same confirmed cases before and after the election.
#### •	And, I’d like to find if there is any correlation between state holding its primary election during coronavirus pandemic and the number of confirmed cases in each state
#### •	State election date and the number of confirmed cases by state
    o	For state primary election date – will get data from National Conference of State Legislatures  
    o	For confirmed cases – will get data from Johns Hopkins coronavirus map 
#### •	Data points 
    o	Before the election; at the election day; two weeks after election; one month after the election 
    o	Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, Alaska
