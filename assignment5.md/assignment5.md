# Assignment 5

### I was able to find clean data sets for my final project, so I did in-class activity that I was not able to finish last week.
### I successfully went through until I need to visualize the data set. However, my outputs looked somewhat different from the instruction. I tried to figure out what I did wrong or where I made a mistake (or mistakes) but couldn't find it.

### I'm turning in three screenshots of terminal and jupyter lab. And, I'm turning in the large data set that I found online.
