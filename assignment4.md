## Fewer people practicing social distancing as the weather gets warmer, and its impact on the spread of COVID-19

### I plan to analyze how warmer weather impacts the spread of coronavirus, especially when fewer people are practicing social distancing as the weather gets warmer. I’m planning to get the data from Johns Hopkins University coronavirus map and the Weather Channel. 
### I was having a hard time finding the correlation between warmer weather and fewer people practicing social distance, but there is data available to track whether or not people practiced social distancing from February to April. According to the cell phone data from SafeGraph, we can know the locations of about 18 million mobile phones across the country. According to the data, the nation saw a decline in social distancing in late April. 
### I could visualize how fewer people practice social distancing as the weather gets warmer through a graph and compare the graph with another graph with daily confirmed cases in the United States. 
### It is timely as coronavirus is still outbreaking in the country. The weather is getting warmer and clearly fewer people are practicing social distancing. It’s newsworthy because social distancing is a key to prevent the spread of COVID-19, so if I visualize this data, people can clearly see how it’s relevant and how it’s affecting the spread of the virus. 
### For the source, I could talk to virus-related experts and university professors to get insights on how fewer people practicing social distance and the impacts of this related to the spread of covid-19.
